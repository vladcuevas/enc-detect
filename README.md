# enc-detect

enc detect (encoding detect) is a very small python tool created to convert from any kind of encoding to any kind of encoding.
* Support for encodings from Python 3.11

In the example, there is a list that contains the directories where files with encoding UTF-16LE exists. 
Then the application walks the directory getting the file names for the files, later is created a new file in the output directory with the files with the new encoding.
